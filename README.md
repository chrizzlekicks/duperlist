#Duperlist

This is the official project repo of Duperlist, the todolist for anyone who cannot wait for the release of Superlist.
This list will be updated on a regular basis, with several new features added step by step.

The logic of the todolist app is entirely built with JavaScript, the design with Bootstrap. Clearly, the focus of this application was solely on the functionality, therefore additional input regarding new features but also design modifications are highly appreciated.

Cheers!
