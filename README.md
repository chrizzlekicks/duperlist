# Duperlist

This is the official project repo of Duperlist, the todolist for anyone who cannot wait for the release of Superlist.
This list will be updated on a regular basis, with several new features added step by step.

Check the current status here: [Duperlist](https://chrizzlekicks.github.io/duperlist/duperlist.html)

## Current Features

* Add and delete to-dos to list
* Add and remove to-dos to local storage
* Clear entire list and local storage by hitting 'Clear' button
* Click list item to indicate that task is done

## Features to Come

* Search/filter tasks
* Edit tasks
* Change the order of tasks 

The logic of the todolist app is entirely built with JavaScript, the design with Bootstrap. Clearly, the focus of this application was solely on the functionality, therefore additional input regarding new features but also design modifications are highly appreciated.

Cheers!
